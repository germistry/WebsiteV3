# WebsiteV3 - germistry aka Krystal Ruwoldt

This is the repository for my website. <br/>
It's a basic ASP.NET CORE 3.1 website for my portfolio and blog. </br>
I use:
<ul>
  <li>
    Trumbowyg plugin for my editor pages 
  </li>
  <li>
    Photosauce Magic Scaler for my dynamic images 
  </li>
  <li>
    NetCore.Mailkit for sending auto emails (and I wrote a <a href="#">blog post</a> about using this wonderful package)
  </li>
  <li>
    Bootstrap 4.3.1 and Bootstrap-tables 1.17.1
  </li>
  <li>
    Jquery Validation  
  </li>  
  <li>
    Microsoft ASP.NET Core Identity 
  </li>
</ul>
I am hosting this site with [I'm an inline-style link with title](https://www.smarterasp.net "SmarterAsp") - and so far I have found them to be excellent, especially for hosting an ASP application. Total breeze deploying the site through VS to their servers AND they have great response times to any query (like 10 minutes!)
